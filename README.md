# Task 01 – Data Visualization

## Objective
To visualize the distribution of a continuous variable using a histogram.

## Dataset
- World Bank Population Data
- File used: `API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_174326.csv`

## Methodology
- Loaded the dataset using Pandas
- Cleaned the data by handling missing values
- Selected the latest available year
- Visualized population distribution using a histogram

## Visualization
- Histogram showing population distribution across countries

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## Outcome
The visualization shows that most countries have relatively smaller populations,
while a few countries have very large populations, resulting in a right-skewed
distribution.
